# Revolte

Revolte is an adventure game to onboard Web2 users into Web3.
We want to provide a complete journey with a real immersive story to attract people and encourage to achieve small steps to continue to follow up the narrative. These steps (like installing a wallet) are mandatory to get access to the next part of the story.

This playful fiction explains and illustrates each concept and tool in a non boring/forbidding way, with a relation with story events. The level of knowledge is increasing slowly to keep everyone in the adventure. It is inspired from https://cryptozombies.io/ but instead of learning Solidity the goal of the project is to learn basic tasks:
- Install and use a wallet
- Execute transactions
- Swap tokens,
- Use decentralized applications
- Discover Layer 2 like Optimism 

## Overview

It will be very close to an interactive comic based on a dystopian universe. The adventure will be split in 3 sections :
 1. Prelude : No relation with Web3. The aim is to introduce the story/universe and to grab audience's attention.
 2. At the end of the prelude, events from the story require a wallet installation. The narration of the story details how it works
 3. The third section explains concepts (like public/private key, gas, token, block explorer, NFTs) of Web3
 4. The fourth section goes deeper in Web3 use : swap, deposit/borrow, layer 2 

## Story

Several stories are possible and choices must be done by the community
